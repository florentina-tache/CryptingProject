The purpose of this project is to encrypt a text using a specific key by two diffent crypting methods and I hacve chosen Playfair and Bifid Ciphers. Initially, the inputs are initialized with value read from a local file. The user can also choose their input. The output can be seen after pressing the "Encrypt" button, and it can also be converted back to the original text by pressing the "Decrypt" button.
